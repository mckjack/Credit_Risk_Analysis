# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview 
The overview of this challenge was to build machine learning models to build credit risk. We built these models through Python. Below we see the results for the different kind of models that were made to predict this data. 
## Results 
### Random OverSample Model

- we see here that the balance accuracy score was 63%
- high risk precision is 1 %  with 71% sensitivity resulting in a F1 of 2%
- low risk precision is 100% with 54% sensitivity

### SMOTE

- balance accuracy score of 66%
- high risk precision is 1% with 62% sensitivity resulting in a F1 of 2%
- low risk precision is 100% with 67% sensitivity

### Undersampling

- balance accuracy score of 52%
- high risk precision of 1% with 61% sensitivity resulting in a F1 of 1%
- low risk precision of 100% with 43% sensitivity

### Over and Under Sampling Combo

- balance accuracy score of 63%
- high risk precision of 1% with 71% sensitivity with 2% F1
- alot of false positives of low risk with sensitivity of 54%
